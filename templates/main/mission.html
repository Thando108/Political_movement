                        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Sankirtana is considered the yuga-dharma (the prescribed method for spiritual realization in the current age, Kali Yuga). It involves the congregational chanting of the holy names of Krishna, especially the Hare Krishna mantra.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This practice purifies the heart, fosters unity among participants, and brings about spiritual awakening and inner joy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quotes:</strong> "In this age of Kali, the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Krishna mantra, is the incarnation of Lord Krishna. Simply by chanting the holy name, one associates with the Lord directly. Anyone who does this is certainly delivered." – Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi-lila 17.22</p>

                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Bhakti refers to pure, selfless devotion to Krishna. It is the highest goal of life and the means to attain eternal happiness and spiritual fulfillment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practices:</strong> Bhakti includes hearing about Krishna, chanting His names, remembering Him, serving His lotus feet, offering prayers, worshiping His deity form, serving Him personally, becoming His friend, and surrendering everything to Him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quotes:</strong> "Bhakti, or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and one’s senses are purified simply by being employed in the service of the Lord." – Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu 1.1.12</p>
